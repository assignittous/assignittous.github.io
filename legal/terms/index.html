A single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as you&apos;d like.</li>      <li>The downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;</li>      <li>Your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;</li>      <li>You have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;</li>      <li>The Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>      <li>The Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>      <li>The Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;</li>      <li>Your Account is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;</li>      <li>You have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Assign It To Us or otherwise.</li>      <li>If you delete Content, Assign It To Us will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.
Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Assign It To Us has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Assign It To Us&rsquo;s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Assign It To Us&rsquo;s reasonable opinion, violates any Assign It To Us policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in Assign It To Us&rsquo;s sole discretion. Assign It To Us will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</li></ul></li>  <li>API Terms<ol><li>Need something simple here</li></ol></li>  <li>Payment and Renewal.<ol><li>General Terms.
By selecting a payment plan, you agree to pay Assign It To Us the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a monthly basis on the day you sign up for the Account and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. Upgrade fees are not refundable.</li>      <li>Automatic Renewal.
Unless you notify Assign It To Us before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Account, your Account subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Account (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Accounts can be canceled at any time in the Accounts section of your site&rsquo;s admin console.</li>      <li>What is a Freelancer?  Usually a small agency or self-employed worker who needs to manage a maximum of 2 projects at any one time. Your either doing the work yourself or have one other employee who is working with you on the projects.</li>      <li>What is a Project Manager? The Project Manager needs to manage multiple projects and has a team of developers working on one or more of these projects.  The PM is the administrator that manages all the users, clients and projects for his/her company.  One project manager account can add an unlimited number of team members.</li>      <li>What is a Team Member?  The team member is limited to create and assign tasks and enter time for the tasks. They do not have the administrative rights to manage the users, clients and projects. Team members can also include your project client and stakeholder users but they are restricted to managing their tasks and time entry only.  (Do we mention that a client needs to sign up for a PM account if they need to see the dashboard or reports? Does the PM send the reports to the client?  What if the client needs PM access to the app?)</li>      <li>The 30 Day Trial Period. What if I start my account mid-month?  The trial period starts on the day you register for your account and we only start billing you at the end of the trial period.  If the trial period ends in the middle of the month, we will prorate your monthly fee based on the high water mark of the number of user accounts for that month divided by the number of days remaining for the month. For example, you have signed-up for 3 project manager accounts. There are 30 days in the month and your trial period ends on the 15th of that month.  You will be billed $75. (3 Project manager accounts x $50 = $150 multiplied by 50% which is half of one month or 15 days remaining in the 30 day month period)</li>      <li>What is High Watermark Billing? What if I change my account mid-month? Billing will be based on the maximum number of users that were simultaneously active at any one time during the calendar month. So, if you have 2 project manager accounts for part of the month and then add a new project manager user, you will be charged $150 for that month ($50 times 3 users).</li>      <li>Accepted Payments? We accept all major credit cards.</li>      <li>Canceling your Account.  You can cancel at any time by selecting the cancel option on your account page. If you cancel your account in the middle of a month, the monthly fee for that month will be prorated based on the number of complete days during that month when the account was active.</li>      <li>Upgrade or Downgrade. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or functionality of your Account. Assign It To Us does not accept any liability for such loss.</li></ol></li><li>Responsibility of Website Visitors.
