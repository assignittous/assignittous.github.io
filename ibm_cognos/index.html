You're a small to midsize company but you still need business reporting and analytics to improve business processes, identify opportunities for growth and maintain your competitive advantage.  </p><p>Enterprise, commercial-off-the-shelf software have their place, but they're designed to be everything to everyone. 
They make money by selling expensive software with dense feature lists that require scarce skill sets and specialized training...and that can leave your business out in the cold.         </p><p>Midsize companies need analytic solutions that work better with busy IT staff and limited budgets. </p></div><div class="col-md-6"> <p> 
We've designed and built Knodeo, which is a simple but powerful data warehouse, reporting and analysis framework.
Our framework allows you to build only what you need, with no added fluff. It's also better than building from scratch, as our stack is built from 
proven, open source technologies. And the best part of our solution, is that your software licenses have zero cost. Yes, you read that right. You 
only pay us for the services work to build what you need.</p><p> 
The true value comes from experts at Assign It To Us who use this technology to build the right solution for your corportate reporting and 
analytics.  There are no upfront software costs so these solutions show immediate return on investment and help your company grow. </p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="row"><h3 class="push-bottom-36px">What is Knodeo?</h3><p>Knodeo is an acronym for <b>Kn</b>owledge <b>O</b>n <b>D</b>emand&mdash; <b>E</b>xtensible and <b>O</b>pen. Knodeo is a comprehensive solution to your business reporting needs.</p><p> 
Knodeo is an end-to-end solution that migrates and transforms your business data into a data warehouse, and delivers insight and knowledge  
in the form of reports and dashboards.</p><p> 
Built on widely accepted open source 
technologies, Knodeo is an affordable reporting solution for businesses of all sizes. </p></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="row"><h3 class="push-bottom-36px">Why use Knodeo?</h3><p>Deploying an enterprise reporting solution often isn't as easy as you might be led to believe.
Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions are often a little too generic to specifically address your reporting needs, and customizing them can take longer than writing something from scratch.</p><p> 
Enterprise software companies make money by selling expensive software with dense feature lists that require  
scarce skill sets.</p><p> 
By using open source technologies, Knodeo lowers 
licensing costs and makes it easier to find skilled people to accomplish the same task.</p><p> 
Knodeo 
makes it easy to tailor a solution specifically for your business instead of paying full price for a 
commercial solution and only using 20% of its functionality.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="content even"><h3 class="push-bottom-36px">Knodeo Benefits</h3><div class="container">  <div class="row"><div class="table image-list"><div class="tr"><div class="td image"><img src="/_assets/images/knodeo1.png" alt="Knodeo Data Hub" style="width:250px;height:auto;padding-right: 20px"/></div><div class="td body"><h5>A Home For Your Data</h5><p> 
The heart of any good reporting system is the data. The old saying "garbage in, garbage out" 
is particularly important when you are trying to analyze your data.</p><p> 
Knodeo 
provides a centralized home for 
your data in the form of a Data Warehouse. It doesn't matter whether your data is in a database, flat file or in the cloud. Knodeo can get it.</p><p>Beyond giving your data a home, Knodeo's tools move, clean and transform the data so that any analysis performed on it is accurate and actionable.             </p></div></div><div class="tr"><div class="td image"><img src="/_assets/images/knodeo2.png" alt="Knodeo Savings" style="width:250px;height:auto;padding-right: 20px"/></div><div class="td body"><h5>Big Savings</h5><p>The Knodeo core software itself is free. That includes the data migration tools, database server, server OS and web portal. You can have as many servers, users, CPUs and environments as you'd like without ever paying extra for Knodeo licenses. Compare that to other solutions, which have arcane licensing schemes with annual maintenance charges. </p><p>Simply put, you only pay for the development of your data warehouse, reports and dashboards. </p><p> 
Since Knodeo is extensible and open, 
add-on components are also available for purchase (or for free) by Assign It To Us or Knodeo partners. You can even develop your own add-on component 
and sell it.</p></div></div><div class="tr"><div class="td image"><img src="/_assets/images/knodeo3.png" alt="Knodeo Insight" style="width:250px;height:auto;padding-right: 20px"/></div><div class="td body"> <h5>Insight and Analysis</h5><p>Data is not information, and information is not insight. Your data needs to take several transformative steps before it is truly useful.</p><p> 
Baked into the Knodeo development process is taking the time to understand your business data and user requirements so that 
your business logic is already in the data warehouse, 
ready to be analyzed in the form of reports and dashboards. </p></div></div><div class="tr"><div class="td image"><img src="/_assets/images/knodeo4.png" alt="Knodeo Toolbox" style="width:250px;height:auto;padding-right: 20px"/></div><div class="td body">      <h5>A Toolbox, Not A Tool</h5><p>When you've only got a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you've spent a lot of money on a name-brand reporting solution, every information request quickly starts to look like a nail.</p><p>We've seen it happen many times&mdash; you've spent a lot of money on a tool, and your team only knows one tool, so you use that tool to solve every problem, even when it's not the best tool for the job.</p><p> 
Knodeo is a toolbox, not a tool. You aren't limited to using Knodeo tools in that toolbox.
You can use any existing data-capable products your company might already have. And because the core Knodeo platform is free, your decisions on what tools to use to solve a business problem aren't influenced by a sunk cost.</p><p>So whether you do everything in the Knodeo web portal, or mix and match with tools like Cognos, Tableau or Excel, it's your choice.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="content odd"><h3 class="push-bottom-36px">Building Your Solution</h3><div class="container">   <div class="row">     <div class="col-md-6"><div> <h4>Delivering Business Results for Less</h4><p>With Knodeo, the difference is that the software is not part of the cost equation. With other commercial reporting solutions, you've spent tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars on software licensed before you've even spent a dime on services.</p><p>Knodeo allows you to bypass the software costs and divert that money towards building your ideal reporting solution.      </p></div><div style="padding-top:40px">   <h5>AITU Agile Development</h5><div class="image"><img src="/_assets/images/sprint.png" alt="Knodeo Reporting" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"/></div></div></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="table icon-list"><div class="tr"><div class="td icon"><i class="aitu-logo"></i></div><div class="td"><h5>Knowledge and Insight</h5><p>Knowledge and insight don't grow on trees.

This allows us to iterate quickly without losing sight of key deadlines and milestones.</p><p>To support our customer projects, we've even written our own project management software, <a href="../assign_it_to_me/">Assign It To Me</a>.   </p></div></div><div class="tr"><div class="td icon"><i class="aitu-logo"></i></div><div class="td"><h5>Training and Support</h5><p>Unlike other reporting solutions, there's nothing proprietary about the Knodeo platform. 
The core skillset of Knodeo development&mdash; SQL, Javascript, CSS and HTML are easy to find and learn. Most web developers have these skills, and you don't have to pay artifically inflated prices for a proprietary skillset.</p><p>If you'd like to take on Knodeo development yourself, we can provide training catered to your team members' skill levels in the context of your business data.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="content even"><h3 class="center">Deploying Knodeo<p>
