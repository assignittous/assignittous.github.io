        h6 A Home For Your Data                
        p 
          | The heart of any good reporting system is the data. 
          | Knodeo provides a centralized home for your data in the form of an Analytics Database. It doesn't matter whether your data is in a database, flat file or in the cloud. Knodeo can get it.
        p Beyond giving your data a home, Knodeo's tools move, clean and transform the data so that any analysis performed on it is accurate and actionable.

        h6 Insight and Analysis                 
        p Data is not information, and information is not insight. Your data needs to take several transformative steps before it is truly useful.
        p 
          | Baked into the Knodeo development process is taking the time to understand your business data and user requirements so that 
          | your business logic is already in the analytics database, 
          | ready to be analyzed in the form of reports and dashboards.

        h6 Big Savings                 
        p The Knodeo core software itself is free. That includes the data migration tools, database server, server OS and web portal. You can have as many servers, users, CPUs and environments as you'd like without ever paying extra for Knodeo licenses. Compare that to other solutions, which have arcane licensing schemes with annual maintenance charges. 
        p Simply put, you only pay for the development of your data warehouse, reports and dashboards. 
        p 
          | Since Knodeo is extensible and open, 
          | add-on components are also available for purchase (or for free) by Assign It To Us or Knodeo partners. You can even develop your own add-on component 
          | and sell it.

        h6 A Toolbox, Not A Tool                 
        p When you've only got a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you've spent a lot of money on a name-brand reporting solution, every information request starts to look like a nail.       
        p 
          | Knodeo is a toolbox, not a tool. You aren't limited to using Knodeo tools in that toolbox.
          | You can use any existing data-capable products your company might already have. And because the core Knodeo platform is free, your decisions on what tools to use to solve a business problem aren't influenced by a sunk cost.
        p So whether you do everything in the Knodeo web portal, or mix and match with tools like Cognos, Tableau or Excel, it's your choice.
